The `MyHiddenMarkovModel` mutable struct represents a hidden Markov model (HMM) with discrete states.

### Required fields
- `states::Array{Int64,1}`: The states of the model
- `transition::Dict{Int64, Categorical}`: The transition matrix of the model encoded as a dictionary where the `key` is the state and the `value` is a `Categorical` distribution
